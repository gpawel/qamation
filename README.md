# jmeter-java-sampler-excel
Package "jmeter-java-sampler-excel" contains JMeter Java Sampler to read data from an Excel file. This is my first attampt to integrate JMeter and Apache POI library to give tester better than csv file data source. Of cource, this facility should be given in a form of JMeter Configurator. I am working on it.
